Instructions for how to use application
All instructions should be written in Markdown in README.md file

Front end quality / User experience
User interaction with application should be functional
Users should be able to figure out implementation of application with basic review
Responsiveness (mobile and desktop) is NOT required

Back end stability
Node and npm should be used with proper .gitignore and package.json setup
Application should run in development environment (localhost)
